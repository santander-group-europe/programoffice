The **InnerSource Program Office** aspires to be the place to share the knowledge and experiences InnerSource adoption, becoming the catalyst of InnerSource initiatives across the bank.

## Mission
* Fostering cross-collaboration, transparency, reuse, and optimization.
  - Communicate, announce, facilitate the contact among people and projects.
* Educate InnerSource stakeholders.
* On-boarding mentoring.
* Developers engagement and talent retention.
* Provide help:
  - creating a community culture
  - adopting InnerSource tools and processes
  - using metrics and KPI's to track InnerSource adoption
  - defining standard policies for contributions
* Provide resources to ease projects to start creating or moving their work into an InnerSource model.

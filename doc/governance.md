# Governance model

In InnerSource, governance is described in the "governance model" document, defined by [OSSWatch](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels) as follows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      A governance model describes the roles that project participants can take on and the process for decision making within the project. In addition, it describes the ground rules for participation in the project and the processes for communicating and sharing within the project team and community.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

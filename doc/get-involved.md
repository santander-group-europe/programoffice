## How to get Involved (at the moment only for Organization members)
* Join the Microsoft Teams InnerSource channel.
  * You can also join the [kanban](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.planner/_djb2_msteams_prefix_2471044500?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A4d3100f1c661432da6b2cfdcafd8c549%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=f1886bc7-cdad-4513-9544-1c9587de1c77&tenantId=35595a02-4d6d-44ac-99e1-f9ab4cd872db) used to sync. Happy if you help move forward some of the tasks!
* Collaborate in our GitHub projects.
* Participate in our meetings:
  - Meetups
  - Trainings
  - ...or any other ISPO meeting you may be interested in.
* Give talks sharing your experience (meetups, training sessions, etc.).


### About the kanban

This is the default kanban provided by Teams with some extra flavors.
There are several columns:
* Backlog: please feel free to open a new ticket for us if you think we can help with any task. However we recommend you first contact us to double check if this makes sense under the ISPO umbrella. In general these are the tasks still to be done. On weekly or bi-weekly meetings we'll decide which ones to move forward, so to the Scheduled column.
* Scheduled: this is the list of tasks to work on during the next iteration, which usually takes one or two weeks.
* Waiting for Project: as the ISPO is heavily dependent on the projects this is assisting, there may be tasks blocked by them or that need a specific action on their side. Those tasks will be here.
* Doing: anything we're working at should be here.
* Review: once someone has finished to work on a given task, this is the column to let other review the work done.
* Done: this is the last step before officially closing the task. During the ISPO meetings, these tasks may be simply closed, or other tickets may be created at some point.

The recommendation is to move tasks from the left to the right in the kanban, and avoid moving tasks to the left again when possible. Remember to add yourself as assignee of the task if you are working on it. This will let other know that you are the owner of this task at least for a while.
